# RC-car-obstacle-avoidance-Arduino
This was my project for university at Measurements and Actuators.
I've got an old RC car which was not working anymore and I decided to bring it back to life with my knowledge.
I've kept the original RC car mainboard to have simple acces to motor and other actuators.
For this project I used an Arduino Mega 2560,an ultrasonic sensor,a servo motor,and other electronic components to fully connect this and make it work.
My RC car was equiped with RX-2C integrated circuit which controlled everything and with some googling I managed to get the datasheet and discovered how to control the mainboard.
